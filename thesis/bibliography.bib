  abstract = {Due to the fast spread of data through digital media, individuals and societies must assess the reliability of information. Deepfakes are not a novel idea but they are now a widespread phenomenon. The impact of deepfakes and disinformation can range from infuriating individuals to affecting and misleading entire societies and even nations. There are several ways to detect and generate deepfakes online. By conducting a systematic literature analysis, in this study we explore automatic key detection and generation methods, frameworks, algorithms, and tools for identifying deepfakes (audio, images, and videos), and how these approaches can be employed within different situations to counter the spread of deepfakes and the generation of disinformation. Moreover, we explore state-of-the-art frameworks related to deepfakes to understand how emerging machine learning and deep learning approaches affect online disinformation. We also highlight practical challenges and trends in implementing policies to counter deepfakes. Finally, we provide policy recommendations based on analyzing how emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be employed to detect and generate deepfakes online. This study benefits the community and readers by providing a better understanding of recent developments in deepfake detection and generation frameworks. The study also sheds a light on the potential of AI in relation to deepfakes.},

  abstract = {Falling hardware prices and ever more displays being connected to the Internet will lead to large public display networks, potentially forming a novel communication medium. We envision that such networks are not restricted to display owners and advertisers anymore, but allow also passersby (e.g., customers) to exchange content, similar to traditional public notice areas, such as bulletin boards. In this context it is crucial to understand emerging practices and provide easy and straight forward interaction techniques to be used for creating and exchanging content. In this paper, we present Digifieds, a digital public notice area we built to investigate and compare possible interaction techniques. Based on a lab study we show that using direct touch at the display as well as using the mobile phone as a complementing interaction technology are most suitable. Direct touch at the display closely resembles the interaction known from classic bulletin boards and provides the highest usability. Mobile phones preserve the users' privacy as they exchange (sensitive) data with the display and at the same time allow content to be created on-thego or to be retrieved.},

  abstract = {The current technological landscape has been profoundly shaped by rapid and significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sparking extraordinary interest in academia and beyond. Considered an unprecedented revolutionary technology, it has captured the attention of researchers, scholars, and professionals from various disciplines as it offers transformative prospects in a wide range of fields. This technological progress has sparked a broad debate on its social, ethical, and economic impacts, raising important questions that require in-depth and multidisciplinary investigations. AI thus emerges as an ever-evolving discipline with significant implications for the future of human progress. Besides being seen as an opportunity to pursue common societal goals, many observers have recognized the potential risks associated with such developments. Its integration into the political context also presents a promising opportunity to enhance the efficiency of political decisions however, its adoption raises significant challenges that require careful evaluation. The aim of this research is to explore in detail the relationship between AI and political communication, focusing on the analysis of AI's usage in this context while highlighting the phenomenon of deepfakes, which jeopardize democratic stability and security in many cases. The importance of this research contribution lies in the context where AI is assuming an increasingly prominent role in daily dynamics, making it essential to fully understand the implications and potential consequences of AI application in the political field. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess whether such initiatives can genuinely be considered democratic or if they could represent a dangerous trend towards the use of manipulative algorithms.},

  abstract = {Image source forensics is commonly regarded as one of the most effective methods for blindly verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital images. The most recent topic related to image source forensics is the detection of DeepFakes generated using Generative adversarial networks (GANs). In recent years, with the rapid growth of GANs, a photo-realistic image can be easily generated from a random vector. Moreover, the images generated by advanced GANs are very realistic. It is reasonable to acknowledge that even a well-trained viewer has difficulties distinguishing artificial from real images. Therefore, detecting DeepFakes generated by GANs is an important task. By reviewing the background of DeepFakes detection methods, this paper aims to provide readers with a systematic understanding of GAN, its variants used to create DeepFakes, and, more crucially, methods proposed to identify DeepFakes in the literature to date.},

  abstract = {The recent proliferation of fake portrait videos poses direct threats on society, law, and privacy [1]. Believing the fake video of a politician, distributing fake pornographic content of celebrities, fabricating impersonated fake videos as evidence in courts are just a few real world consequences of deep fakes. We present a novel approach to detect synthetic content in portrait videos, as a preventive solution for the emerging threat of deep fakes. In other words, we introduce a deep fake detector. We observe that detectors blindly utilizing deep learning are not effective in catching fake content, as generative models produce formidably realistic results. Our key assertion follows that biological signals hidden in portrait videos can be used as an implicit descriptor of authenticity, because they are neither spatially nor temporally preserved in fake content. To prove and exploit this assertion, we first engage several signal transformations for the pairwise separation problem, achieving 99.39\% accuracy. Second, we utilize those findings to formulate a generalized classifier for fake content, by analyzing proposed signal transformations and corresponding feature sets. Third, we generate novel signal maps and employ a CNN to improve our traditional classifier for detecting synthetic content. Lastly, we release an "in the wild" dataset of fake portrait videos that we collected as a part of our evaluation process. We evaluate FakeCatcher on several datasets, resulting with 96\%, 94.65\%, 91.50\%, and 91.07\% accuracies, on Face Forensics [2], Face Forensics++ [3], CelebDF [4], and on our new Deep Fakes Dataset respectively. In addition, our approach produces a significantly superior detection rate against baselines, and does not depend on the source, generator, or properties of the fake content. We also analyze signals from various facial regions, under image distortions, with varying segment durations, from different generators, against unseen datasets, and under several dimensionality reduction techniques.},

In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe.Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts.Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered.Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field.Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field.},

Deepfakes threaten public and personal safety by facilitating disinformation, propaganda, and identity theft. Though research has been conducted on human performance in deepfake detection, the results have not yet been synthesized. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates human deepfake detection accuracy. Searches in PubMed, ScienceGov, JSTOR, Google Scholar, and paper references, conducted in June and October 2024, identified empirical studies measuring human detection of high-quality deepfakes. After pooling accuracy, odds-ratio, and sensitivity (d') effect sizes (k~=~137 effects) from 56 papers involving 86,155 participants, we analyzed 1) overall deepfake detection performance, 2) performance across stimulus types (audio, image, text, and video), and 3) the effects of detection-improvement strategies. Overall deepfake detection rates (sensitivity) were not significantly above chance because 95\% confidence intervals crossed 50\%. Total deepfake detection accuracy was 55.54\% (95\% CI [48.87, 62.10], k~=~67). For audio, accuracy was 62.08\% [38.23, 83.18], k~=~8; for images, 53.16\% [42.12, 64.64], k~=~18; for text, 52.00\% [37.42, 65.88], k~=~15; and for video, 57.31\% [47.80, 66.57], k~=~26. Odds ratios were 0.64 [0.52, 0.79], k~=~62, indicating 39\% detection accuracy, below chance (audio 45\%, image 35\%, text 40\%, video 40\%). Moreover, d' values show no significant difference from chance. However, strategies like feedback training, AI support, and deepfake caricaturization improved detection performance above chance levels (65.14\% [55.21, 74.46], k~=~15), especially for video stimuli.},

First, a compact summary of DL techniques used for deepfakes is presented. Then, a review of the fight between generation and detection techniques is elaborated. Moreover, we delve into the potential that new technologies, such as distributed ledgers and blockchain, can offer with regard to cybersecurity and the fight against digital deception. Two scenarios of application, including online social networks engineering attacks and Internet of Things, are reviewed where main insights and open challenges are tackled.

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

We conduct 5 pre-registered randomized experiments with N = 2215 participants to evaluate how accurately humans distinguish real political speeches from fabrications across base rates of misinformation, audio sources, question framings with and without priming, and media modalities. We do not find base rates of misinformation have statistically significant effects on discernment. We find deepfakes with audio produced by the state-of-the-art text-to-speech algorithms are harder to discern than the same deepfakes with voice actor audio. Moreover across all experiments and question framings, we find audio and visual information enables more accurate discernment than text alone: human discernment relies more on how something is said, the audio-visual cues, than what is said, the speech content.},

  abstract = {This paper defends two main theses related to emerging deepfake technology. First, fears that deepfakes will bring about epistemic catastrophe are overblown. Such concerns underappreciate that the evidential power of video derives not solely from its content, but also from its source. An audience may find even the most realistic video evidence unconvincing when it is delivered by a dubious source. At the same time, an audience may find even weak video evidence compelling so long as it is delivered by a trusted source. The growing prominence of deepfake content is unlikely to change this fundamental dynamic. Thus, through appropriate patterns of trust, whatever epistemic threat deepfakes pose can be substantially mitigated. The second main thesis is that focusing on deepfakes that are intended to deceive, as epistemological discussions of the technology tend to do, threatens to overlook a further effect of this technology. Even where deepfake content is not regarded by its audience as veridical, it may cause its viewers to develop psychological associations based on that content. These associations, even without rising to the level of belief, may be harmful to the individuals depicted and more generally. Moreover, these associations may develop in cases in which the video content is realistic, but the audience is dubious of the content in virtue of skepticism toward its source. Thus, even if---as I suggest---epistemological concerns about deepfakes are overblown, deepfakes may nonetheless be psychologically impactful and may do great harm.},

Fake footage, images, audios, and videos (known as deepfakes) can be a scary and dangerous phenomenon and can have the potential of altering the truth and eroding trust by giving false reality. Proof of authenticity (PoA) of digital media is critical to help eradicate the epidemic of forged content. Current solutions lack the ability to provide history tracking and provenance of digital media. In this paper, we provide a solution and a general framework using Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track the provenance and history of digital content to its original source even if the digital content is copied multiple times. The smart contract utilizes the hashes of the interplanetary file system (IPFS) used to store digital content and its metadata. Our solution focuses on video content, but the solution framework provided in this paper is generic enough and can be applied to any other form of digital content. Our solution relies on the principle that if the content can be credibly traced to a trusted or reputable source, the content can then be real and authentic. The full code of the smart contract has been made publicly available at Github.},

  abstract = {The creation or manipulation of facial appearance through deep generative approaches, known as DeepFake, have achieved significant progress and promoted a wide range of benign and malicious applications, e.g., visual effect assistance in movie and misinformation generation by faking famous persons. The evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake detection aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid development of the DeepFake-related studies in the community, both sides have formed the relationship of battleground, pushing the improvements of each other and inspiring new directions, e.g., the evasion of DeepFake detection. Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the new direction is unclear and neglected by recent surveys due to the rapid increase of related publications, limiting the in-depth understanding of the tendency and future works. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the research work on the topic of DeepFake generation, DeepFake detection as well as evasion of DeepFake detection, with more than 318 research papers carefully surveyed. We present the taxonomy of various DeepFake generation methods and the categorization of various DeepFake detection methods, and more importantly, we showcase the battleground between the two parties with detailed interactions between the adversaries (DeepFake generation) and the defenders (DeepFake detection). The battleground allows fresh perspective into the latest landscape of the DeepFake research and can provide valuable analysis towards the research challenges and opportunities as well as research trends and future directions. We also elaborately design interactive diagrams (http://www.xujuefei.com/dfsurvey) to allow researchers to explore their own interests on popular DeepFake generators or detectors.},

In this work we discuss these challenges, and explore the design space of gaze-enabled public displays. We conclude by discussing how the current state of research stands wrt. the identified challenges, and highlight directions for future work.},

EyeScout addresses key limitations of current gaze-enabled large public displays by offering two novel gaze-interaction modes for a single user: In ``Walk then Interact'' the user can walk up to an arbitrary position in front of the display and interact, while in ``Walk and Interact'' the user can interact even while on the move. We report on a user study that shows that EyeScout is well perceived by users, extends a public display's sweet spot into a sweet line, and reduces gaze interaction kickoff time to 3.5 seconds -- a 62\% improvement over state of the art solutions. We discuss sample applications that demonstrate how EyeScout can enable position and movement-independent gaze interaction with large public displays.},

Teachers are primarily expected to teach children safe online behaviours, despite not necessarily having the required training or classroom tools to support this education. Using the theory of procedural rhetoric and established game design principles, we designed a classroom-based cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy game for tweens that has since been deployed to over 300 Canadian elementary schools. The game, A Day in the Life of the JOs, teaches children about 25 cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy topics and allows them to practice what they have learned in a simulated environment. We employed a user-centered design process to create the game, iteratively testing its design and effectiveness with children and teachers through five user studies (with a total of 63 child participants and 21 teachers). Our summative evaluation with children showed that the game improved their cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy knowledge and behavioural intent and was positively received by them. Our summative evaluation with teachers also showed positive results. Teachers liked that the game represented the authentic experiences of children on digital media and that it aligned with their curriculum requirements; they were interested in using it in their classrooms. In this article, we discuss our process and experience of designing a production quality game for children and provide evidence of its effectiveness with both children and teachers.},

An often underused resource in public spaces -- public displays -- can be used to stimulate these needs. In this paper we argue for a new research direction that explores how public displays can stimulate such essential needs in public spaces. We describe and conceptualize related processes that occur around public displays, based on indepth observations of people interacting with a publicly fielded display application in a city center. Our conceptualization is meant to lay the foundations for designing engaging public display systems that stimulate PACD, and for supporting the analysis of existing deployments.},

Since then, these ``deepfakes'' have advanced significantly.In this article, we explore the creation and detection of deepfakes and provide an in-depth view as to how these architectures work. The purpose of this survey is to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of (1) how deepfakes are created and detected, (2) the current trends and advancements in this domain, (3) the shortcomings of the current defense solutions, and (4) the areas that require further research and attention.},

This study investigates the public's perception of Sora OpenAI, a pioneering Gen-AI video generation tool, via social media discussions on Reddit before its release. It centers on two main questions: the envisioned applications and the concerns related to Sora's integration. The analysis forecasts positive shifts in content creation, predicting that Sora will democratize video marketing and innovate game development by making video production more accessible and economical. Conversely, there are concerns about deepfakes and the potential for disinformation, underscoring the need for strategies to address disinformation and bias. This paper contributes to the Gen-AI discourse by fostering discussion on current and future capabilities, enriching the understanding of public expectations, and establishing a temporal benchmark for user anticipation. This research underscores the necessity for informed, ethical approaches to AI development and integration, ensuring that technological advancements align with societal values and user needs.},

Inner city areas, airports, train stations and stadiums are experiencing a transformation from traditional to digital displays enabling new forms of multimedia presentation and new user experiences. Imagine a walkway with digital displays that allows a user to immerse herself in her favorite content while moving through public space. In this paper we discuss the fundamentals for creating exciting public displays and multimedia experiences enabling new forms of engagement with digital content. Interaction in public space and with public displays can be categorized in phases, each having specific requirements. Attracting, engaging and motivating the user are central design issues that are addressed in this paper. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the design space explaining mental models and interaction modalities and we conclude a taxonomy for interactive public display from this analysis. Our analysis and the taxonomy are grounded in a large number of research projects, art installations and experience. With our contribution we aim at providing a comprehensive guide for designers and developers of interactive multimedia on public displays.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach.The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package---PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)---that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

We envision these interfaces as dynamic platforms that leverage interactive elements and contextual cues to deliver timely security information and guidance to users. We identify four key objectives: raising awareness, triggering actions, providing control, and sparking conversation. Drawing upon Sasse et al.'s Security Learning Curve, we outline the stages for supporting users in adopting new security-related routines into habits, encompassing knowledge, concordance, self-efficacy, implementation, embedding, and secure behavior. Insights from research on public displays and spontaneous interactions inform the design of public security user interfaces tailored to different environments and user groups. Furthermore, we propose research questions pertaining to stakeholders, content, user interface design, and effects on users and discuss challenges as well as limitations. Introducing public security user interfaces to bridge the gap between cybersecurity experts and lay users sets the stage for future research and development in this emerging field.},

The prevalence of manipulated photos in our everyday lives invites an important, yet largely unanswered, question: Can people detect photo forgeries? Previous research using simple computer-generated stimuli suggests people are poor at detecting geometrical inconsistencies within a scene. We do not know, however, whether such limitations also apply to real-world scenes that contain common properties that the human visual system is attuned to processing. In two experiments we asked people to detect and locate manipulations within images of real-world scenes. Subjects demonstrated a limited ability to detect original and manipulated images. Furthermore, across both experiments, even when subjects correctly detected manipulated images, they were often unable to locate the manipulation. People's ability to detect manipulated images was positively correlated with the extent of disruption to the underlying structure of the pixels in the photo. We also explored whether manipulation type and individual differences were associated with people's ability to identify manipulations. Taken together, our findings show, for the first time, that people have poor ability to identify whether a real-world image is original or has been manipulated. The results have implications for professionals working with digital images in legal, media, and other domains.},

  abstract = {Public displays are widely used for displaying information in public space, such as shopping centres. They are typically programmed to display advertisements or general information about the space in which they are situated. Due to recent advances in technology, public displays are becoming ubiquitous in space around cities and can potentially enable new interactions with public space. However, despite these advances, research reports that public displays are often found to be: (1) generally irrelevant to the space in which they are situated; and (2) ignored by passers-by. Although much research has focused on tackling these issues, a gap remains regarding knowledge about how public displays in the wild are currently being used at a time when people are increasingly relying on their smartphones as a main source for accessing information and for connecting with others. The study reported in this article aims to address this gap by presenting new insights about the current practices of non-research public displays and their role in a hyperconnected society. To achieve this, we provide results from a field observation study of non-research public displays and contextualise our findings within an analysis of related work. This article makes three main contributions: (1) identifying how user engagement with public displays has changed over the past 10 years; (2) understanding how the pervasiveness of smartphones and other connected devices has modified whether users notice public displays and their interactions with public displays; and (3) outlining design recommendations and opportunities towards making public displays more relevant in a hyperconnected society.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, rapid progress in AI, machine learning, and deep learning has resulted in new techniques and various tools for manipulating multimedia. Though the technology has been mostly used in legitimate applications such as for entertainment and education, etc., malicious users have also exploited them for unlawful or nefarious purposes. For example, high-quality and realistic fake videos, images, or audios have been created to spread misinformation and propaganda, foment political discord and hate, or even harass and blackmail people. The manipulated, high-quality and realistic videos have become known recently as Deepfake. Various approaches have since been described in the literature to deal with the problems raised by Deepfake. To provide an updated overview of the research works in Deepfake detection, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) in this paper, summarizing 112 relevant articles from 2018 to 2020 that presented a variety of methodologies. We analyze them by grouping them into four different categories: deep learning-based techniques, classical machine learning-based methods, statistical techniques, and blockchain-based techniques. We also evaluate the performance of the detection capability of the various methods with respect to different datasets and conclude that the deep learning-based methods outperform other methods in Deepfake detection.},

Many scholars and journalists have begun attending to the political risks of deepfake deception. Here we investigate other ways in which deepfakes have the potential to cause deeper harms than have been appreciated. First, we consider a form of objectification that occurs in deepfaked `frankenporn' that digitally fuses the parts of different women to create pliable characters incapable of giving consent to their depiction. Next, we develop the idea of `illocutionary wronging', in which an individual is forced to engage in speech acts they would prefer to avoid in order to deny or correct the misleading evidence of a publicized deepfake. Finally, we consider the risk that deepfakes may facilitate campaigns of `panoptic gaslighting', where many systematically altered recordings of a single person's life undermine their memory, eroding their sense of self and ability to engage with others. Taken together, these harms illustrate the roles that social epistemology and technological vulnerabilities play in human ethical life.},

  abstract = {When used maliciously, deepfake can pose detrimental implications to political and social forces including reducing public trust in institutions, damaging the reputation of prominent individuals, and influencing public opinions. As there is currently no specific law to address deepfakes, thus deepfake detection, which is an action to discriminate pristine media from deepfake media, plays a vital role in identifying and thwarting deepfake. This paper provides readers with a comprehensive and easy-to-understand state-of-the-art related to deepfake generation and detection. Specifically, we provide a synthesized overview and recent progress in deepfakes by categorizing our review into deepfake generation and detection. We underline publicly available deepfake generation tools and datasets for benchmarking. We also provide research insights, discuss existing gaps, and present trends for future research to facilitate the development of deepfake research.},

  abstract = {In this work we propose a novel model-based deep convolutional autoencoder that addresses the highly challenging problem of reconstructing a 3D human face from a single in-the-wild color image. To this end, we combine a convolutional encoder network with an expert-designed generative model that serves as decoder. The core innovation is our new differentiable parametric decoder that encapsulates image formation analytically based on a generative model. Our decoder takes as input a code vector with exactly defined semantic meaning that encodes detailed face pose, shape, expression, skin reflectance and scene illumination. Due to this new way of combining CNN-based with model-based face reconstruction, the CNN-based encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful parameters from a single monocular input image. For the first time, a CNN encoder and an expert-designed generative model can be trained end-to-end in an unsupervised manner, which renders training on very large (unlabeled) real world data feasible. The obtained reconstructions compare favorably to current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and richness of representation.},

The study involved a large temporary interactive public display on a central city square showing a selection of custom-made content. We have evaluated the effect on passers-by and spectators in two conditions: 1) non-interactive (2102 passers-by, 228 viewers), by showing a content loop, and 2) interactive (1676 passers-by, 257 viewers), by adding physical pushbuttons for content selection and gaming. We discuss the influence of non-interactive and interactive public displays on: 1) attracting attention, 2) engaging people, 3) improving social dynamics within and among groups of viewers, and 4) catering for the suitable time of day. Based on our observations, we provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that interactive displays are more successful than non-interactive displays to engage viewers, and to make city centers more lively and attractive.},
